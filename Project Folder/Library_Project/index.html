ToDo:
    1. create book objects that are going to be stored into an array
        - Create constructor to automate creating a book

    2. Create a function apart from constructor that will create a book and 
        store user input as a new entry in an array made for the user.
        - Each book is made with a unique ID generated by crypto.randomUUID()
    
    3. Crate a function that loops through array and displays each book on
        - display in a table or grid
        - create some manual books for now
        - end goal, recreate elements dynamically
